A critical issue arose after an extended battle.\n\nOnce there were no smaller Fairies to cannibalize, the queen entity became frenzied, unable to find a way to sate its hunger. The destructive power behind its strikes grew by multiple magnitudes as well.\n\nA swift retreat was our only option, as it was determined that we could not recover from that particular blow. It can be determined that a prolonged battle will not be in our favor; we must find a way to suppress the entity quickly.\n\nConcluding the report.\n\n→ Oi, the big one kept chomping down on the smaller ones whenever it looked like it was 'bout to kick the bucket.

However, we have also identified various additional attack patterns from the entity.\n\nUsing the information gathered in the previous encounter, the Sinners did not attack the smaller Fairies, preventing the larger entity from cannibalizing them.\n\nHowever, repeated use of that strategy invariably led to the queen growing frenzied, clearly unable to withstand its hunger.\n\nAnother, previously unidentified element in this battle has also been observed.\n\nAs the battle continued, we noticed that smaller Fairy entities would sometimes join the battle. Perhaps this can be attributed to the existence of a colony that we have yet to discover.\n\nAlthough we were unable to confirm whether they were a permanent addition to the battle, the conclusion remains the same: a prolonged battle will be to our disadvantage. A concrete, calculated strategy is recommended against this entity.\n\nConcluding the report."}]},
